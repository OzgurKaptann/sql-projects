# A/B Test Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project evaluates the impact of an A/B experiment on conversion rates.  
Two groups (Control vs Experiment) are compared to measure the effect of a new feature or design.

## 🎯 Business Goal
To determine whether the new variant (Group B) significantly improves **conversion** compared to the baseline (Group A).  
The results guide **data-driven product decisions**.

## 🛠️ SQL Techniques Used
- GROUP BY aggregations
- Conversion rate calculation
- CTEs for lift comparison
- CASE WHEN for segmentation

## 📊 Key Metrics
- Conversion rate per group
- Absolute & relative lift (%)
- Experiment vs Control performance
